Rent-Map
========

This is a rent map that will first attempt to show rent pricing in East Harlem.

I am presently learning and trying out almost every function of every tidbit of code.

I have used the basic tile layer from Mapbox.

I created GeoJSON file from shape files found <a href="http://www.nyc.gov/html/dcp/html/bytes/dwnzdata.shtml">here</a>
